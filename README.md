Business Insights:
1.	When do users leave reviews?
o	Insight: The "Review Time of Day" section shows when users are most likely to leave reviews. Are reviews posted more frequently during the day, night, or specific hours? This tells you if there are specific patterns in user behavior or whether users prefer to review during certain times (e.g., after purchasing or at specific hours of the day).
2.	How long are users’ reviews?
o	Insight: The "Word Count by Users" section reveals how verbose or concise users are in their reviews. Are certain users more detailed or do they provide short comments? This helps identify engaged vs. less-engaged users or those with higher emotional investment in the product (longer reviews often correlate with stronger feelings).
3.	How do users’ ratings compare to the overall product ratings?
o	Insight: The "Average Rating by Users" section displays the average rating given by each user and how this compares to the product's overall rating. It helps identify outliers, such as users who tend to rate highly or critically, and it provides insights into rating consistency across the user base.
4.	How does sentiment correlate with ratings and reviews?
o	Insight: By analyzing sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) against ratings, you can see how rating scores align with emotional tone. Are users giving high ratings and leaving positive reviews, or are there discrepancies between ratings and sentiment?
5.	Which categories have verified customers and how do they compare?
o	Insight: The "Verified Customers for Each Category" section allows you to see the distribution of verified purchase reviews per category. You can assess if verified reviews tend to skew positive or negative across categories, helping gauge product trustworthiness.
6.	Which users write the most reviews?
o	Insight: The "Top Reviewers by Volume" section identifies the most prolific reviewers by volume of reviews written. This tells you which users are consistently leaving feedback, allowing you to pinpoint loyal customers, advocates, or potentially spammy reviewers.
